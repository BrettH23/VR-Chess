Okay so, easiest way to get started understanding the VR Chess project
is to start with our main game scene. 

game_scene.html is a an html file which contains the game scene itself
which is under the tag, <a-scene>

Everything visually seem on start up when loading up, specifically 
the game_scene.html site will be within this tag. 
Lets call this section, section 1.0 for reference. 

below that, have a script tag, which is used add event listeners,
or just let us know we are connected, once we connect. 
It fires, expectedly, when you connect. 

Within a-scene you'll see a the networked-scene component and some attributes for
tldr: This lets NAF know this is a networked scene. Please see comments or the NAF
documentaion for more information 

Below that, you'll see <a-assets> which is where we load our assets.
This is where we load our models, textures, and sounds.
This is where we can also give them a unique id, which we can reference

at the very top, you'll see audio tags, which are used to load our sounds
below that, you'll see models being loaded,
